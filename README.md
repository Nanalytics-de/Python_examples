# My Python Projects Repository üêç
Welcome!  
This is my personal repository where I collect and store Python projects, scripts, and code snippets I created and still create in my retraining as an [IT specialist in data and process analysis (IHK)](https://www.bbq.de/umschulung/koeln/fachinformatiker-datenanalyse-und-prozessanalyse-data-science/). It is a showcase of my learning and experiments using Python during that time.
